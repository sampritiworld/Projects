		<div id="content">I wanted to create this site because I wanted to help those with Alzheimer's in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, Alzheimer’s doesn’t have a cure yet so the best thing we can do right now is to help improve their quality of life. One of my close relatives had Alzheimer's and he had a lot of trouble remembering things.  Sometimes he would forget the names of his own family members. I remember walking into his house awe-struck at the number of sticky notes and reminders for himself on the walls. There were little pieces of paper everywhere, big whiteboards with more writing. He even had signs above every utility in his house and how to use them.  He was very afraid of losing himself and not remembering things, so whatever he recalled, he wrote down. I saw how difficult it was for him and the people around him. That is why I want to help others with Alzheimer's to improve their day-to-day activities in a simple yet fun way.
