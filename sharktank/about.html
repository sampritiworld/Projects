		<div id="content">I wanted to create this site because I wanted to help those with Alzheimer's in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, Alzheimer’s doesn’t have a cure yet so the best thing we can do right now is to slow it down. One of my close relatives had Alzheimer's and he had a lot of trouble remembering things.  Sometimes he would forget the names of his own family members. I remember walking into his house, awe-struck at the number of sticky notes and reminders for himself on the walls. There were little pieces of paper everywhere and big whiteboards reminding him of his day-to-day tasks. He even had signs above every appliance in his house and how to use them.  He was very afraid of losing himself and not remembering things, so whatever he recalled, he wrote down. I saw how difficult it was for him and the people around him. That is why I want to help others with Alzheimer's to improve their memory in a simple yet fun way. </div>
